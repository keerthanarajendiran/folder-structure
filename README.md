## Overview

Given a JSON tree with leaf nodes as an array. Represent it in the form of a folder structure where upper nodes act as folders and leaf nodes act as files.

There should be a clear distinction between the folders and files, and the interaction on folders should work properly (i.e. clicking on arrow should hide/show the child folders and files)

**Each subfolder should be indented accordingly to its depth in the tree, a user should be able to Create/Edit/Delete a file or folder to the user's desired location.**
